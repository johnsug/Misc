## CLIF Energy Gels Flavor Log

| Flavor | C  | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|----|--------|----------|
| CLIF Razz | 0mg | 2.5/5 | super sweet -> weird sour taste/aftertaste; stomach not happy afterwards |
| CLIF Chocolate | 0mg | 4/5 | ok, but I liked GU chocolate a bit better |
| CLIF Vanilla | 0mg | 4/5 | solid flavor (cream cheese frosting) |
| CLIF Strawberry | 25mg | 2.5/5 | like razz, started very sweet, ended with a weird sour taste |
| CLIF Chocolate Cherry | 100mg | 3/5 | ok; dark chocolately |
| CLIF Citrus | 25 mg | 3/5 | ok taste, nothing to write home about; a tad too sweet |

Chocolate and vanilla were my favorite -- if I were to buy more CLIF, I'd go with them and skip the rest.
