|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Joe's KC | Olathe/Leawood, KS | 5/5 | Consistently bomb-diggity and my favorite sauce (only thing lacking is the sides) |
| Q39 | Kansas City, MO | 5/5 | Blown away; it lived up to its reputation (I tried thier chipotle-cilantro, zesty, and classic sauces; all three were vinegar-based, but still pretty good -- I liked the original the best) | 
| Jon Russell's Barbeque | Overland Park, KS | 4/5 | Pretty good |
| Arby's | (everywhere) | 4/5 | Surprisingly very happy with their brisket sandwich |
| Jack Stack | Kansas City, MO | 3.5/5 | Better than average, but I guess I was expecting more? Burnt ends were ok, ribs good, but wasn't crazy about the runny sauce |
| Three Little Pigs BBQ | Crown Center, Kansas City, MO | 2/5 | Meh |
| Johnny's BBQ Olathe | Olathe, KS | 2/5 | Meh + runny red-sauce |

| ? | Kansas City, MO | 3/5 | OK -- first burnt ends |
