## Halo Top Flavors

### Contenders (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Peanut Butter Cup | 6g | 5/5 | was the gold standard, but Cookie Dough is making me question that... (but might still squeak ahead due to its lower carb count?) |
| Cookie Dough | 8g | 5/5 | very good, but perhaps a *tad* too sweet? |
| Sea Salt Caramel | 7g | 5/5 | very good; base similar but not exactly the same as Cookie Dough's base |
| Peaches and Cream | 8g | 5/5 | very good, but higher carb **seasonal only** |
| Red Velvet | 8g | 5/5 | I go back and forth, but still apprecaite this one |
| Gingerbread House | 8g | 4.5/5 | higher carb, but very tasty **seasonal only** |
| Cinnamon Roll | 10g | /5 | *10g! ouch... but reviewed well ("like a Cinnabon!")* |
| Birthday Cake | 6g | 3.5/5 | tastes exactly like birthday cake |
| Chocolate Banana | 7g | 3.5/5 | liked the banana flavor (Laffy Taffy!) but the almost-burnt chocolate sort of brings it down |

| Lemon Cake | 5g | 3/5 | didn't really like, but *maybe* try again?? |
| Strawberry | 6g | 3/5 | meh, but perhaps it was too melted |
| Pumpkin Pie | 10g | /5 | ok, but nothing to write home about **seasonal only** |
| Blueberry Crumble | 8g | 3/5 | ok **seasonal only** |
| Mint Chip | 6g | 2.5/5 | mint sensation VERY strong, chocolate chips very bitter... |
| Oatmeal Cookie | 6g | 2.5/5 | kinda blah + oats were chewy/offsetting |
| Cookies and Cream | 8g | 2.5/5 | taste is ok; hint of coconut, hint of oreo, but otherwise no real flavor? |
| Candy Bar | 8g | 2.5/5 | first time ok w/ a spoon of peanut butter; second time raw was unimpressed / nuts not very pleasant |
| S'mores | 8g | 2.5/5 | weird coconut/marshmallow cream flavor with weirder small, hard crunches; each bite was more and more disappointing :( |
| Chocolate | 5g | 2/5 | accidently bought, sad dissapointment; was expecting PB Cup's chocolate, was left with a sad fudgesicle |
| Rainbow Swirl | 6g | 1/5 | gross, could not finish (*I guess I'm to blame... I was expecting it to taste like rainbow sherbet, but nope, not at all; just fruity disappointment*) |
| Pancakes & Waffles | 8g | 1/5 | super sweet and super bitter at the same time, could not finish |
| Vanilla Bean | 5g | 1/5 | sad dissapointment, did not finish *(was hoping it'd be more like the base of cookie dough; nope, not at all)* BUT, ok w/ a banana in a milkshake... |
| Pancakes & Waffles | 8g | 1/5 | super sweet and super bitter at the same time, couldn't finish more than 10% |
