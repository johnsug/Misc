Miscellanous logs as I discover which forms of fitness nutrition work best for me.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Unable to get down; avoid |
| 2 | Hard to get down |
| 3 | Edible |
| 4 | Decent |
| 5 | Gold standard, go-to fuel option |

*Note, stay away from Hammer Nutrition ... nasty, sour, floury, etc :/*
